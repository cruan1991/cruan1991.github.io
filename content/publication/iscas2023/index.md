abstract: As global data volume explodes, traditional storage systems face multiple challenges, including the lack of resources and low cost-efficient. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has attracted researchers' attention as a novel storage medium to address these issues with its high storage density, low maintenance cost, and extremely long shelf life. Specifically, DNA is also environmentally friendly compared to traditional disk storage because the disk is non-degradable. In this paper, we propose a strategy for image coding and storage based on compressing intra-predicted images from Versatile Video Coding (VVC) using synthetic genomics theories that enable the high throughput storage of images on DNA. We first define the length and format of the DNA oligo for the implementation of a storage system. Then we improve the LT codes to become a feasible DNA coding scheme. Last but not least, we design a voting mechanism to achieve the error correction function for robustness. The experimental results show high compression efficiency while achieving several strict biological constraints, such as GC-content balance and homopolymer control.
