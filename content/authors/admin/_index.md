## Let's Chat

I am an **AI researcher** specializing in tokenized video compression, DNA-based data storage, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

My work has been published in leading venues including IEEE ISCAS, ICME, VCIP, and Scientific Reports. To date, I have presented at **9** IEEE conferences and published in **4** journals, with contributions recognized at IEEE VCIP 2023, IEEE ISCAS 2023/2024/2025, IEEE ICME 2025, Stem Cells, Scientific Reports and Nature Methods.

I am currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University, where I explore Generative AI applications for multimodal medical data.

ðŸš€ I am open to **collaborations and opportunities** in AI, multimodal learning, and compression, and am actively seeking Machine Learning Engineer roles where I can apply my expertise to impactful real-world problems.

ðŸ’¬ If you are interested in me or my work, please feel free to reach out â€” I truly enjoy both telling stories and listening to them.
