Just returned from **ICME 2025 in Nantes, France** — grateful, inspired, and energized!

This year’s conference was a fantastic opportunity to meet researchers from all over the world, share ideas, and explore exciting trends in multimedia and signal processing.

## 🎤 Research Presentation

Rongduo Han and I had the pleasure of presenting **two of our latest works on DNA storage**, including our new deep generative compression framework — *HybridFlow-DNA*. We were thrilled by the enthusiasm and insightful feedback from the audience. It’s encouraging to see how bio-inspired storage is gaining momentum across disciplines.

Huge thanks to **Prof. Nam Ling** for his continued mentorship and guidance, and to our wonderful co-authors **Lei Lu**, **Wei Wang**, **Wei Jiang**, and **Qiming (Kimmy) Yuan** — this work wouldn't have been possible without your efforts and collaboration.

## 🌐 Connections & Conversations

The questions, conversations, and encouragement we received were incredibly motivating. I was also lucky to meet many new friends — thank you all for your thoughtful insights and shared curiosity!

It was a joy to connect with **Linus Müller**, **Jingwen Feng**, **Changyong He**, **Chaker Larabi**, and many others — your work is truly inspiring.

## 🍷 Impressions from Nantes

Some things just stick with you — like the scenic views of the Loire River, and the unforgettable oyster buffet at the conference reception.

Looking forward to reconnecting with everyone at **ICME 2026 in Thailand** 🇹🇭!
