From **2016** to **2025**, this Ph.D. journey has been a tapestry of challenges, growth, and countless moments of kindness. Looking back, I’m proud I kept going—and even more grateful for everyone who walked with me.

My research focused on **DNA-based data storage, learned/generative compression, and multimodal AI**. From early ideas to published papers and conference discussions, each step was built on patience, teamwork, and curiosity.

## 🚀 What’s next

Graduation is a milestone, not an ending. I’ll continue building in **AI, multimodal learning, and compression**, and I’m excited to push forward **DNA storage** and **ultra–low bitrate video/image compression**.

If you’re interested in my work—or in collaborating—**please reach out**. I love telling stories, and I love hearing yours.

**Here’s to 2016–2025—and to everything ahead.**
